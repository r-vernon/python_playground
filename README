The aim of this folder/project is to play around with python

I'm commenting for myself, so only comment sections I think I'll
struggle to understand, not for a more general audience

Similarly, I'm less focussed on breaking scripts down into various
sub-functions, as the intent is to have quick scripts I can scroll
through, rather than a serious code base
